= user-rhat-worker-id-labeler

This operator provides a work-aroud for not being able to retrieve arbitrary claims through OpenID Connect and OpenShift oauth.

A Script Mapper is configured in keycloak to combine the user name and rhatWorkerId into a single string:

--------
var userName = token.getOtherClaims().get("name");
var rhatWorkerId = token.getOtherClaims().get("rhatWorkerId");
var Output = userName + " [" + rhatWorkerId + "]";
Output;
--------

For example: `Johnathan Kupferer [54703]`

This utility watches OpenShift users and when they are an `@redhat.com` user with a display name of this form it will patch the user to put the rhatWorkerId in the label `redhat.com/rhatWorkerId` and remove it from the display name.
